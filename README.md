EVM Compatible Bridge Oracle

We can connect each seperate blockchain to each other via 'Bridge Oracles'. We can exchange data and coins, etc... between blockchains for example we can lock ether in the Ethereum blockchain and then via bridges mint equal amount of locked ether as wrappeed-ether in the Solana blockchain and also we can transfer data between Ethereum and Solana networks (blockchians) via using 'Bridge Oracles';
